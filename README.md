# coupled-systems-generator
Functions that generate time-series of coupled systems of your choice.
This version is designed for Matlab/Octave.

Completed:
* coupledlogistic.m:  build the time-series for a system of coupled Logistic maps

Under development:
* coupledshift.m: the same for coupled Bernoulli shift maps
* coupledtent.m: the same for coupled tent maps
* coupledstandard.m: the same for coupled (Chirikov) standard maps (kicked rotor)
* coupledikeda.m: the same for coupled Ikeda maps
* coupledarnoldtongue.m: the same for coupled Arnold tongue maps
* coupledkaplan.m: the same for coupled Kaplan-Yorke maps
* coupledgauss.m: the same for coupled Gauss maps
* coupledcomplexsquare.m: the same for coupled Complex Squaring maps
* coupledlorentz.m: the same for coupled Lorentz systems
* coupledhenon.m: the same for coupled Henon maps
* coupledrossler.m: the same for coupled Rossler systems
* coupledduffing.m: the same for coupled Duffing systems
* coupledchua.m: the same for coupled Chua circuit systems
* coupledvanderpol.m: the same for coupled Van der Pol oscillators
* coupledoscillators.m: the same for coupled oscillators (may or not be Kuramoto)
